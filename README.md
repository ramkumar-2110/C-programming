# C Programming – Complete Course Repository

##  Overview
This repository contains my **complete C programming course work**, organized into
different assessment folders.  
Each folder focuses on a specific concept of C programming and includes multiple
programs written for practice and learning.

The repository is structured step by step, starting from basic concepts and moving
towards more advanced topics.
