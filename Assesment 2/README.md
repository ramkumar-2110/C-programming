# Assessment 2 – Decision Making Without `if` / `if-else`

##  Description
This folder contains C programs that demonstrate **decision-making logic without using**
`if` or `if-else` statements.

The programs rely on alternative approaches to control program flow and make decisions,
helping to understand how logic can be implemented in different ways.

##  Techniques Used
- Conditional (ternary) operator `?:`
- Logical operators
- Arithmetic logic
- Switch-like behavior using expressions

##  Objective
To strengthen problem-solving skills by implementing decision making **without traditional
conditional statements**.

##  Language
- C Programming
