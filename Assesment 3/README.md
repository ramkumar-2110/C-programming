# Assessment 3 – Decision Making Using `if`

##  Description
This folder contains C programs that demonstrate **decision-making using only the `if`
statement**.

All problems are solved **without using `if-else`, switch, or conditional operators**.
The goal of this assessment is to understand how logical conditions can be applied using
a single `if` statement to control program flow.

##  Concepts Covered
- Simple `if` statement
- Relational operators (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `==`, `!=`)
- Logical operators (`&&`, `||`)
- Condition-based execution

## Objective
To strengthen the understanding of **basic decision-making logic** by solving problems
exclusively with the `if` statement.

##  Language
- C Programming
