# Assessment 4 – Looping Using `goto` with `if`

##  Description
This folder contains C programs that demonstrate **looping behavior using the `goto`
statement combined with the `if` condition**.

Traditional looping constructs such as `for` and `while` are **not used** in this
assessment. Instead, repetition is achieved by manually controlling program flow using
`goto` and conditional checks.

##  Concepts Covered
- `goto` statement
- `if` condition for loop control
- Manual repetition of code blocks
- Flow control and jump statements

##  Objective
To understand how loops work internally by recreating looping logic using
`goto` and `if`, and to gain deeper insight into program control flow.

> Note: The use of `goto` is for **learning purposes only** and is generally
> discouraged in real-world applications.
